# hello-world
Testing ground for becoming more confident with GitHub.

This paragraph #1 is the first edit I have made in the hello-world readme file. I am following the instructions on GitHub's [Hello World tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). I am hoping that eventually I will feel more comfortable using GitHub and other version control tools, and maybe one day even feel comfortable using VC in the command line.
